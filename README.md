# OpenSense NoSignal
## Intentional Communication Absence Framework

### Purpose
Managed state system for meaningful silence and communication boundaries.

### Core Concept  
- **Structured Absence**: NoSignal as intentional state, not error condition
- **Communication Boundaries**: Defining when absence carries meaning
- **State Preservation**: Maintaining integrity during silent periods

### Architecture
#### Key Components
- Policy-driven filtering rules
- Automated integrity verification
- Context-aware suppression algorithms
- Real-time adaptation to signal conditions

### Integration
Primary filter feeding opensense-noise with rejected interference
